    "2. You can use 'if' or 'if-else'\n",
    "3. Use methods like split(), istitle(), title(), replace(), len(), lower(), etc. to produce the multiline string.\n",
    "4. Do not use replace() function more than once\n",
    "5. Use string methods to get the 'C' from the name variable\n",
    "6. Use len() function to calculate the total characters in the final text to produce the '508' number\n",
    "7. Do not use any methods or tricks that we have not yet covered in the lecture yet\n",
    "8. After your code successfully prints the 'output_text', compare it with the test_text. If everything goes well, the two text strings will match. \n",
